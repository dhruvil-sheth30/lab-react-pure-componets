# Answer to Component Performance Comparison

Both `SimpleCounterComponent` and `PureCounterComponent` are expected to perform similarly in this scenario. The components are relatively simple, and the rendering logic doesn't introduce significant computational overhead. React's optimizations efficiently handle updates in both cases. The choice between Simple class and pure components is not likely to have a noticeable impact on performance for this use case.
